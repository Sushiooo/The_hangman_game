[Basic Irl]
One player think of a word or phrase and the other(s) player(s)

[My_Program_rules]
The player have to guess the word or sentence that is integred in the data base of the game.

# How does it work ?

You have to type an alphabetical character nor the entire word / sentence in the Guess

Only Alphabetical is allowed (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ)

Exemple :

You see -> _ _ _ _ _ _
You can type a or banana
If you typed 'a' and there isn't a 'a' you get -1 guess
If there is a 'a' in the sentence then you don't loose guess + the a get displayed in the sentence
like that -> _ a _ a
then you type 't'
          -> tata
If you type banana and this isn't banana you get -2 guess
You also can't type a sentence longer nor smaller than the sentence that you have to guess.
